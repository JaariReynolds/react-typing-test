Monkey-type inspired typing test app created with React and Typescript. Still a work in progress.

- Currently contains:
  * Word length and timed tests
  * WPM counter that updates dynamically during the test
  * Completion/progress bar that updates dynamically during the test
  * Number and Punctuation inclusions/additions to the test
  * General opacity transitions for a more fluid experience
  * WPM graph and general typing test statistics on completion
  * Test words scroll to reveal more words as the test is progressed

- Work in progress:
  * Overall styling of the page is not finalised
  * Inaccuracies with statistics calculations
  * Results page styling
  * Smooth caret transitions during the test
  * A few bugs
