Monkeytype-inspired minimal typing test app created with React and Typescript. Still a work in progress.

- Currently contains:
  * Colour palette selector! More palettes to come
  * Word length and timed tests
  * WPM counter that updates dynamically during the test
  * Completion/progress bar that updates dynamically during the test
  * Number and Punctuation inclusions/additions to the test
  * General smooth transitions for a more fluid experience
  * Smooth caret during the test
  * WPM graph and general typing test statistics on completion
  * Test words scroll to reveal more words as the test is progressed (mostly only noticeable on smaller screen widths)

- Work in progress:
  * Login and highscores
  * LocalStorage user preferences
  * Punctuation option overhaul, currently feels too random/inconsistent
  * A few bugs
